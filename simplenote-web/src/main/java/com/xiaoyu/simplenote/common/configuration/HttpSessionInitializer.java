/**
 * spring官方解释: Our Spring Configuration created a Spring Bean named
 * springSessionRepositoryFilter that implements Filter. The
 * springSessionRepositoryFilter bean is responsible for replacing the
 * HttpSession with a custom implementation that is backed by Spring Session. In
 * order for our Filter to do its magic, Spring needs to load our Configuration
 * class. Last we need to ensure that our Servlet Container (i.e. Tomcat) uses
 * our springSessionRepositoryFilter for every request. Fortunately, Spring
 * Session provides a utility class named
 * AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer both of these steps extremely easy.
 * You can find an example below:
